# Rust wrapper for ADBC drivers

All [ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity)](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/) drivers
(shared libraries) are loaded dynamically.

Drivers are automatically downloaded from the dbt CDN when dbt needs to connect to a
data warehouse.

## Snowflake example

We use the
[ADBC Snowflake Go driver](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/tree/main/go/adbc/driver/snowflake)
for [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com).

```rust,no_run
use adbc_core::options::AdbcVersion;
use adbc_core::{Connection, Statement};
use dbt_adbc::{connection, database, driver, Backend};
use arrow_array::{cast::AsArray, types::Decimal128Type};

# fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

// Load the driver
let mut driver = driver::Builder::new(Backend::Snowflake)
    .with_version(AdbcVersion::V110)
    .build()?;

// Construct a database using system configuration
let mut database = database::Builder::from_snowsql_config()?.build(&mut driver)?;
// ..or from a URI.
let mut builder = database::Builder::new(Backend::Snowflake);
builder.with_parse_uri("my_account/my_db/my_schema?role=R&warehouse=WH")?;
let mut database = builder.build(&mut driver)?;

// Create a connection to the database
let mut connection = connection::Builder::default().build(&mut database)?;

// Construct a statement to execute a query
let mut statement = connection.new_statement()?;

// Execute a query
statement.set_sql_query("SELECT 21 + 21")?;
let mut reader = statement.execute()?;

// Check the result
let batch = reader.next().expect("a record batch")?;
assert_eq!(
    batch.column(0).as_primitive::<Decimal128Type>().value(0),
    42
);

# Ok(()) }
```

## Bumping an ADBC driver version

See an example PR at [dbt-labs/fs#2166](https://github.com/dbt-labs/fs/pull/2166).
To get the checksums into the source code, re-generate with
`./scripts/gen_cdn_driver_checksums.sh`.

If the checksums for the existing drivers change, something is very broken. You
should be able to run the script and get the same checksums as before plus the
new ones based on the new driver version list in the shell script.

## Working on ADBC drivers

Most ADBC drivers we use are written in Go, using the official Go SDKs for each
data warehouse backend.

### Changing driver code

When you need to extend the funcionality of an ADBC diver, you can do so by
cloning our fork of `apache/arrow-adbc` and modifying the Go code of the driver
you want to work on.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dbt-labs/arrow-adbc.git
cd arrow-adbc
cd go/adbc/driver/bigquery  # source directory
go build -v ./...           # build go
cd go/adbc/pkg              # build directory for all Go drivers
make clean || make libadbc_driver_bigquery.dylib
```

Use `make libadbc_driver_bigquery.so` to build the Linux driver, or
`make libadbc_driver_bigquery.dll` to build the Windows driver.

You can replace the `bigquery` driver with `snowflake` if you're building the
Snowflake driver instead.

### Loading the in-development driver

To get `fs` to skip loading the production drivers from the CDN, you need to set
an environment variable that is checked by, and only by debug builds of `fs` and
link to the local driver from the `lib/` folder at the root of the `fs` repo.

```bash
export DISABLE_CDN_DRIVER_CACHE=true
```
When the non-CDN driver is found,
you should see a message like this when you run `fs` or tests that trigger the
loading of ADBC drivers:

```
$ cargo test -p dbt-adbc -- --nocapture
...
WARNING: BigQuery ADBC driver is being loaded from /Users/felipe/code/fs/lib in debug mode.
...
```

The driver is being looked for as a file with the bare driver name with no `lib` prefix or extension (e.g. `adbc_driver_bigquery`, not `libadbc_driver_bigquery.dylib`).

The driver is being looked for in two locations (assuming you keep all the repos in the `~/code` folder).
* First, as `~/code/arrow-adbc/go/adbc/pkg/adbc_driver_bigquery`
* Second, *only if the above folder does not exist*, as `~/code/fs/lib/adbc_driver_bigquery`

Since the 2nd option is pre-empted by the first, it is only useful for people who do not do driver development
(do not have `~/code/arrow-adbc`) but need to try some pre-built non-CDN driver.

Also, when the 1st option is in force, we automatically attempt to rebuild the drivers.
To disable that, set
```bash
export DISABLE_AUTO_DRIVER_REBUILD=true
```

Change the path to the driver to match your local setup and the driver extension
that your system uses (.dylib, .so, .dll).

### Sample commands:
- `DISABLE_AUTO_DRIVER_REBUILD= DISABLE_CDN_DRIVER_CACHE=0 ../fs3/target/debug/dbt seed`  -- dbt project sibling to the fs dir, no auto makefile invocation, will look for local drivers
- `DISABLE_CDN_DRIVER_CACHE= ../fs3/target/debug/dbt seed` -- will still use CDN provided drivers
- `DISABLE_CDN_DRIVER_CACHE=0 cargo run --bin dbt seed` -- when dbt project is a subdir of the `fs` directory we can still look for the arrow-adbc dir, lib dir, and automake (or not)


### Publishing the changes

When you're done with your changes, open a PR against [](https://github.com/dbt-labs/arrow-adbc),
after review and merge, trigger an `ADBC Release` workflow in the `fs`
repository and bump the driver version in `fs`.


### DuckDB specifics

Working on the DuckDB driver is different from others, since it is bundled with DuckDB itself.

For reference, the build process in CI is governed by `~/code/fs/.github/workflows/build-duckdb-driver.yml`
and  `~/code/fs/scripts/build_cmake_duckdb_macos.sh` (and its siblings for Windows and Linux).

As a preliminary for building DuckDB locally, have these cloned in `~/code`:
* `arrow-adbc` from our fork at https://github.com/dbt-labs/arrow-adbc
* `duckdb` from their repo at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb

Then, in `~/code`:
```bash
ln -s arrow-adbc adbc

./fs/scripts/build_cmake_duckdb_macos.sh --build-extension "dylib" --full-version  "0.18.0+dbt99.1.0" --build-target "x86_64-apple-darwin" --workspace "$PWD"
```
(replace `0.18.0+dbt99.1.0` as desired, this is the label of the driver being built)

When successful, this should build the driver as
`~/code/adbc_build/duckdb/adbc_driver_duckdb-0.18.0+dbt99.1.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.dylib`.

To load this driver when fs runs,
* place it at the 1st location option above:
  ```
  ln -s ~/code/adbc_build/duckdb/adbc_driver_duckdb-0.18.0+dbt99.1.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.dylib ~/code/arrow-adbc/go/adbc/pkg/duckdb
  ```
  (Reminder: the loader searches for a file named `duckdb` in that directory — not `libduckdb.dylib`)
* Make sure `DISABLE_CDN_DRIVER_CACHE=true` and `DISABLE_AUTO_DRIVER_REBUILD=true` are set


### Using the REPL

We expose a basic REPL that is tightly coupled with the drivers in order to execute queries against and enable a tighter feedback loop.

To invoke this REPL (for Databricks):

```bash
$ cargo adbc --profile databricks
```

You'll need a `adbc_config.toml` file somewhere with all your profiles. An example is provided in `adbc_conf.toml.example`.

Follow the prompts within the REPL for features such as executing queries, inspect schemas, and check `RecordBatch` objects extracted from the `RecordBatchReader`.
