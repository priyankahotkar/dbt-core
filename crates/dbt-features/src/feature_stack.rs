/// A feature stack is an object that can be initialized with containers of
/// type-erased objects that implement feature-specific services.
///
/// It serves as the root of the dependency graph for all features [1] and a
/// very simple abstract state-machine for the setup and teardown of features.
///
/// The crates implementing features should not depend on the [FeatureStack]
/// struct directly or even the `*Feature` structs, but the more granular
/// services that the features expose (e.g. `SchemaHydratorFactory` in the
/// `TaskRunnerFeature`). If you violate this principle you will end up with
/// a circular dependency and won't be able to build the project.
///
/// Not everything should necessarily go in the feature stack. In fact, the
/// requirements for what goes in the feature stack are very restrictive. These
/// objects should be buildable before everything including the setup of the CLI
/// parser and should only depend on other services in the feature stack, hence
/// the name "stack". Features are stacked on top of each other and can only
/// depend on features below them in the stack. Do not cheat by introducing
/// global singletons or static variables to get around having to pass
/// dependencies through the feature stack.
